# BlackJack-52deck

### Task

Given a deck of 52 cards, develop an application that would help a user play a simplified version of the Blackjack game.

User should see the total amount of points made and on tapping a button, a random card from the deck should be extracted. The total points should be updated and the card removed the deck. 

The game is won when user reaches 21 points and lost for any value above. Once the game has ended, a button to restart it should be visible.

| Card   | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | Ace | Jack | Queen | King |
|--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|-----|------|-------|------|
| **Points** | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 1   | 2    | 3     | 4    |

It is recommanded to use a TDD approach while implementing the solution.
